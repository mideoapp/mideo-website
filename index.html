                iOS and Android devices, by default, are programmed to pause the music whenever you record a video.
                Why? Well, the device manufacturers figured that this is the desired
                behavior for the majority of users, and it wouldn't be worth the
                trouble to add new settings for the feature.
                Therefore, only an app can let you record while music plays -
                <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1358135284?pt=121593755&ct=mideowebsite&mt=8">
                    Mideo</a>
                 is that app.
            </p>

            <p class="separator">
                Below, I'll explain how you can use Mideo for various purposes,
                like how to record the music while music plays or how to play music while recording a video,
                whether you're a dancer, weightlifter, drummer, or singer

                "I don’t like it. I LOVE IT! Ok, this does exactly what it says, but here is what earns it the 5 stars. I messaged the dev, Will Said, and his response was quick and to the point. Part of what makes an app great is how well the developer listens AND responds. Without response, people are left wondering if their questions & comments had been heard. I think it’s important to reward good developers as I most certainly chastise the ones who don’t care. If you have suggestions, if there is something you don’t like, let Will know. I’m not saying he will make those changes, but I’m pretty sure that he will respond to you one way or the other. Take care and enjoy. I hope my review is helpful."

I have to record my videos for my coach and whenever I would record my music would stop and I wanted music. This app helped. At first it didn’t seem to work with my Fit Radio account but with the quick response and effort from will he figured it out in no time. Super fast responses."

                  "Game changer for powerlifters! I love this app. I like to crank music during my sets to stay in the zone. If I want to record my form to check for imbalances and not having music always threw me off. My only problem with this app is if you go to stop recording and accidentally hit record again, the set you just recorded doesn’t get saved. Is there a way the developers can prevent this from happening? Maybe an alert can pop up asking if you want to save the previous recording before recording a new one? Update - Version 5 now asks users for confirmation before deleting the video."

This app allows me to record my drumming with a song playing simultaneously with a click of a button. I had an error saving videos, emailed the app creator, and he fixed it with an update in just a day!"
